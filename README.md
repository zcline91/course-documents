# Course Documents

This is a directory structure and document generator for the various documents one needs to create while teaching a course (e.g. course notes, worksheets, homework, solutions, quizzes, ...).
This is originally designed for a Mathematics course, but I'm sure has applications in other disciplines.

**This is a work-in-progress at the moment, and is not ready to deploy.**

## Notes-to-self

- At present, pdf files will be ignored by git, since the pdfs generated by TeX are reproducible.
This can present a problem if trying to include pdf graphics in a TeX file though.
For that reason, any pdf files in folders named `img` (or subdirectories thereof) will not be ignored

## To-Do

- [ ] Implement the creation of homework solution files
- [ ] Implement the creation of worksheets and notes for class
    - [ ] Create a class for worksheets
    - [ ] Create a class for notes
- [ ] Implement the creation of quizzes
    - [ ] Create a class for quizzes
- [ ] Implement the creation of tests
- [ ] Brainstorm how to store assessment problems in a way which makes them reusable.
- [ ] Add coursewide .sty file (and potentially others for homework, worksheets, etc.)
- [ ] Continue to alter the format of `course_info.json` to store all the necessary info for the course.
- [ ] Make more functions in `config.py` and then make it a command-line program which will set up the whole course if run with no arguments, and will use arguments from the command-line to perform particular tasks after the course has been initialized.
