# Course Documents

This is a directory structure and document generator for the various documents one needs to create while teaching a course (e.g. course notes, worksheets, homework solutions, quizzes, ...).
This is originally designed for a Mathematics course, but I'm sure has applications in other disciplines.

### Notes

- At present, pdf files will be ignored by git, since the pdfs generated by TeX are reproducible.
This can present a problem if trying to include pdf graphics in a TeX file though.
For that reason, any pdf files in folders named `img` (or subdirectories thereof) will not be ignored.

## Set-Up

- `git clone` the repository and don't set this repo as the upstream.
- Edit `scripts/config.json` for your needs in this course.
  - Edit/add problem sources. Problem sources could include textbooks, colleagues, etc. __*IMPORTANT: Use only alphabetical characters for names*__ (maybe use roman numerals for edition numbers of textbooks). These should all be uniquely named, so try not to use the generic `textbook`.
    - `standard_tex_files` is an array of files to be created when a problem is created. The files `statement` and `solution` should be considered the default. Leave this as is if unsure.
    - `directory_levels` indicates for this problem source how deep the    directory structure will go for top-level problems. E.g. if textbook problems will be organized by chapter/section/problem_number, then set this option to 3. Problems may have subparts; this number is indicating how deep in the directory structure problems wil *begin*.
  - Edit/add document types for the course 
    - `default_directory` is the place a new document of that type will be placed, unless otherwise specified. (Note: any strings between @ symbols will be specified at the time of document creation)
    - `default_filename` is the format of the name for a document of that type, unless otherwise specified. (Note: any strings between @ symbols will be specified at the time of document creation)
    - `includes` are the files from the directory of includes that will be imported in order at the top of tex files of the given document type. The `global` and `probimport` should essentially be included in any document type. The `course-info` include is for use with the LaTeX document classes in <https://github.com/zcline91/mytexmf> (Note: For includes for clicker-questions, the include `clicker-questions` must be included before `course-info`.)
    - `autogenerated` is an optional property for document types that can be automatically generated from a list of problems to include. The value of this option is the JSON file to store which problem files to pull. By default, `hw-solutions` is set to be autogenerated as an example.
- Edit `includes/course-info.tex` for the course if you need it.
- Edit `includes/global.tex` to add any packages or macros you will need for the course. This will likely be added to as the course progresses and more macros are needed for more concepts.
- Edit the files in `templates` to suit your needs. Each should have `\newcommand{\rootdir}{ROOTDIR}` and `INCLUDES` somewhere in the preamble, as well as the word `TITLE` somewhere, even if not in `\title`.


## Folder Structure
The top-level directory has the following subfolders (or will after setup):
- `documents`: the folder which will hold all the actual made documents for use in the course (e.g. notes, worksheets, quizzes, tests, etc.)
- `includes`: LaTeX files which will be included in course documents, providing consistency of notation, and functionality for including content of problems
- `problems`: statement and solution files for problems from different sources
- `scripts`: python scripts and accompanying JSON files for automating tasks
- `templates`: templates of course document LaTeX files for easy creation

### Document Creation

Running `scripts/create_document.py` with different options allows for the creation of new LaTeX document course files of different types, with the option to pull all the included files automatically.
