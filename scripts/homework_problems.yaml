# This is an example of how the configuration might look for a document type
# that is autogenerated. The name of this file is specified in config.json
# under the key "autogenerated" of document_types.hw-solutions.
# When the create_document script is called with document_type "hw-solutions",
# and title "Title", the script checks this file for key "Title", and 
# auto-fills the created LaTeX document with the problems specified (which 
# are seen as subdirectories of the problems folder). If any of the specified
# problem files don't already exist, they are created.
