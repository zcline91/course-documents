\begin{covercontent}
  This test contains \numpages\ pages (including this cover page) and \numquestions\ problems.  
  Count the pages to see if any are missing.  
  Write your name on the top of this page, and put your initials on the top of every other page, in case the pages become separated.\\

  You may not use your books, notes, or any calculator on this test.\\

  You are required to show your work on each problem on this test.  
  The following rules apply:\\

  \begin{itemize}
    %\item \textbf{If you use a ``fundamental theorem'' you must indicate this} and explain
    %why the theorem may be applied.

    \item \textbf{Organize your work}, in a reasonably neat and coherent way, in the space provided. 
      Work scattered all over the page without a clear ordering will receive very little credit.  

    \item \textbf{Mysterious or unsupported answers will not receive full credit}.  
      A correct answer, unsupported by calculations, explanation, or algebraic work will receive no credit; an incorrect answer supported by substantially correct calculations and explanations will still receive partial credit.

    \item If you need more space, use the back of the pages.
      \emph{Clearly indicate when you have done this.}
  \end{itemize}
