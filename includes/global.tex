% This file should be included in all documents. Set packages
% such as fonts that should be more or less consistent throughout 
% the course, and define custom commands for specific math 
% conventions so they are consistent throughout, e.g. the notation
% for a vector should be consistent throughout all of a Calc III
% course's documents, so you might include
% \newcommand{\vect}[1]{\vec{#1}}
% If you decide in a future semester on a different notation, then
% changing this one command will update all documents for the whole
% course.

% EXAMPLES
% \usepackage{mathtools}
% \usepackage{xcolor}

% \usepackage{mlmodern}
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% \usepackage{microtype}

% \usepackage{zmacros} % Custom macros in a texmf folder
