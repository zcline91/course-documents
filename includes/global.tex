% This file should be included in all documents. Set packages
% that should be more or less consistent throughout 
% the course, and define custom commands for specific math 
% conventions so they are consistent throughout, e.g. the notation
% for a vector should be consistent throughout all of a Calc III
% course's documents, so you might include one of the following:
%
% \newcommand{\vect}[1]{\vec{#1}}
% \newcommand{\vect}[1]{\mathbf{#1}}
% \newcommand{\vect}[1]{\overrightarrow{#1}}
%
% That way, if you decide in a future semester on a different notation,
% then changing this one command will update all documents for the whole
% course.

% EXAMPLES
% \usepackage{mathtools}
% \usepackage{xcolor}
% \usepackage{booktabs}
% \usepackage{multirow}
% \usepackage{siunitx}

% You can also include custom macros in a local texmf folder:
% \usepackage{zmacros} 
% If doing so, I recommend version controlling this folder and using 
% a remote git repository to make sure it's consistent across all 
% machines you may be using for your course documents. You can also 
% include it as a subrepository, but I think that's probably more of a 
% hassle than it's worth.
